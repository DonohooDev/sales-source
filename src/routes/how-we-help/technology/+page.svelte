                <p class="text-paragraph">
                    We have seen how frustrating bad data, inefficient list building, lack of data
                    verification, and longstanding database misalignments can be. By analyzing error
                    logs, duplicate data, and identifying the symptoms of underlying data gaps, we
                    create and monitor processes for data governance that deepen conversion and
                    minimize risk in your critical pathway. As you mature in funnel operations
                    strategies, the governance of these elements is critical for long-term growth,
                    helping you to concentrate on driving sales instead of bad data.
